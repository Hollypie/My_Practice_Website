            <p>Hello.  I am an aspiring software engineer.  I'm currently enrolled in online college at BYU Idaho. My area of study is Software Development.  I'm working on my web development certificate.  I have already worked in IT world as a graphic designer. I have an associates degree in multimedia communication technology with a focus on design.  I left the workforce many years ago to have a family.  Now that my kids are a little older I am rejoining the workforce.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I currently have a job at my kids school.  I am a school lunch lady. There are many aspects of that job that I enjoy but I don't want to do it forever.</p>
